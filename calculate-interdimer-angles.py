'''
This program uses the MDAnalysis Python packages and calculates MS2 viral capsid 
interdimer contact angles over the course of a trajectory. The center of mass of the
Î±A helices (residues 98-112) are calculated and a vector is drawn to represent the axis
between the two sets of helices in each dimer. Then, the angle between the two vectors
over the trajectory is calculated and plotted.
